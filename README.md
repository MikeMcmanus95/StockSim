This project was built as a submission for the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline assessment, and uses cool technologies like the IEX Stock API along with React, Redux, Node, Express and Sequelize to create a fullstack web application. You can take a look at my code and see how I sanitized the stock data to fit my needs in the front end, as well as how I managed to get realtime price updates with the `useEffect` hook! I also wanted to ensure that my backend routes were secure, so that a user cant open up the console and edit their cash balance! Overall, this was a fun project to work on, and gave me chance to sharpen my skills with the NERD stack.
